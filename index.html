<h1>About</h1>
<p>I am a second year master student at <a href="https://www.amcs.upenn.edu/">Applied Mathematics and Computational Science</a>, department of mathematics, the University of Pennsylvania. I will graduate in May 2021, and then switch to the Ph.D. track of the same program immediately afterwards.</p>
<p>I obtained B.S. with Honour in Mathematics, and B.A. in Chemistry from Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC in Spring 2019.</p>    

<h1>Research Interests</h1>
<p>I am currently under the supervision of Prof. Paris Perdikaris working on topics about Physics-Informed Neural Network and its optimization. I am also involved in a Physcis-Informed DeepONet project.</p>
<p>Besides applied mathematics and mechanics, I am interested in using machine learning to model the physics in mass spectroscopy and liquid chromatography to enhence the sensitivity and interprebilities.</p>
<h1>Teaching</h1>
<p>Spring 2021: ENM531 Data-driven Modeling and Probabilistic Scientific Computing</p>
<p>Fall 2020: MATH432 Game Theory</p>
